# Effective stress at base
This repository serves to calculate the normalised effective stress component at base of the flowfront. The inputfiles are computed by 2d-lbm-dem at different time steps.

Input the path to the corresponding DEM*.dat in the Base_normal_stress.ipynb or Base_normal_stress.py, and then run
python Base_normal_stress.py.
